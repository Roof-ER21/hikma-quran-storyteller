He was not just a king or a prophet; he was a paradigm of faith, courage, wisdom, and profound repentance. He showed humanity that true strength lies in absolute reliance on Allah, that justice is the cornerstone of a righteous society, and that even prophets, in their human capacity, return to Allah in humility and seek forgiveness.\n\nHis story, etched in the Quran and elaborated in the Sunnah, reminds us that trials are a means of purification and elevation, and that sincere repentance is always accepted by Allah. \"O David, indeed We have made you a successor upon the earth, so judge between the people with truth and do not follow [personal] inclination, as it shall lead you astray from the way of Allah.\" (Quran 38:26). His life remains a beacon, illuminating the path of unwavering faith, diligent worship, and the constant striving for justice and closeness to Allah.",

He understood that true kingship was a trust, a heavy mantle of responsibility to guide his people towards the Oneness of Allah and to administer justice with unwavering righteousness.\n\nThis inheritance was a direct favour from the Most High, a testament to the purity of his heart and his unwavering devotion. He recognised that all power and dominion emanated solely from Allah, and this understanding shaped every decision, every decree, and every breath he took, instilling in him a deep sense of humility despite his burgeoning authority.

He recognised Allah's subtle signs even in the smallest of His creatures. His heart swelled with thanks, and he immediately turned to his Lord in prayer, saying: \"My Lord, enable me to be grateful for Your favor which You have bestowed upon me and upon my parents and to do righteousness of which You approve.

This news stirred Sulaiman's heart with concern for their spiritual plight.

His commitment to Allah's laws was absolute, and he spoke out against injustice and moral corruption, even when it meant confronting the powerful and the tyrannical rulers of his time. He understood that a prophet's duty was to uphold divine justice, regardless of the personal cost.\n\nHis voice, though gentle in its compassion for the believers, became a thunderclap against falsehood and oppression. He stood firm, a solitary beacon of integrity, reminding all that Allah's command reigns supreme over all earthly decrees. His life became a living testament to the principle that a believer's allegiance is first and foremost to Allah, and truth must be proclaimed, come what may.",

His uncompromising stand against the moral transgressions of the rulers of his era earned him their wrath.

His final moments were a testament to his profound love for Allah and his dedication to the truth.\n\nHis martyrdom was not an end, but a powerful affirmation of the eternal nature of truth and the supreme value of upholding Allah's word. It cemented his legacy as a prophet who lived and died in complete submission to his Lord, a true 'Sayyidan wa Hasuran wa Nabiyyan minas-Salihin' (noble leader, chaste, and a prophet from the righteous).",

Overwhelmed with modesty and fear, she sought refuge in Allah from what seemed an unwelcome intrusion, crying out, \"Indeed, I seek refuge in the Most Merciful from you, if you should be fearing of Allah!\"\nThe figure, none other than Jibreel (Gabriel) peace be upon him, revealed his true purpose, dispelling her alarm. \"I am only a messenger of your Lord to give you [news of] a pure boy.\" Her astonishment was profound; how could she, a virgin untouched by any man, bear a child? Jibreel affirmed that this was Allah's decree, a simple matter for Him, a sign for humanity, and a mercy from Him.
