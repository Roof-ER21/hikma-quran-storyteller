        <h2>6. Children's Privacy (COPPA Compliance)</h2>

        <div class="important">
            <p><strong>Important for Parents:</strong> This app is designed for families with children aged 4 and above. We take children's privacy extremely seriously and fully comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). This section explains how we protect your child's information and what rights you have as a parent.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>6.1 Verifiable Parental Consent</h3>
        <p>Before any child can access the Kids Mode learning environment, we require verifiable parental consent through our account creation process:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Parent Account Required:</strong> Parents must create an account with their name and a secure 4-digit PIN before children can use the app</li>
            <li><strong>PIN Authentication:</strong> The PIN is hashed using bcrypt encryption and serves as the consent mechanism and ongoing parental gate</li>
            <li><strong>No Direct Child Registration:</strong> Children cannot create accounts or access learning features without prior parent setup</li>
            <li><strong>Access Control:</strong> Parents must enter their PIN to access settings, manage data, or make changes to the child's experience</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>6.2 What Information We Collect From Children</h3>
        <p>We practice strict data minimization when it comes to children's information. Here's exactly what we collect and why:</p>

        <div class="important">
            <p><strong>We DO NOT collect:</strong> Email addresses, phone numbers, photos, videos, home addresses, school information, biometric data, or any government-issued identifiers from children.</p>
        </div>

        <p><strong>Optional Information (Parent-Provided):</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Child's First Name:</strong> Parents may optionally provide a child's first name for personalization (e.g., "Great job, Alaya!"). This field can be left blank or changed at any time.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Educational Progress Data (Automatically Collected During Learning):</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Stars earned and levels completed in the Arabic alphabet learning system</li>
            <li>Letters practiced and recitation attempts (skill tracking only, no audio stored)</li>
            <li>Badges and achievements unlocked</li>
            <li>Stories read and completed activities</li>
            <li>Time spent in educational activities (for progress tracking, not behavioral profiling)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Why We Collect This Data:</strong> Educational progress data is collected solely to provide personalized learning experiences, track skill development, award achievements, and help parents monitor their child's Quran learning journey. We never use this data for advertising, profiling, or any purpose unrelated to education.</p>

        <h3>6.3 AI Tutor and Third-Party Processing</h3>
        <p>Our app includes an optional AI tutor feature powered by Google Gemini. Here's how it works and how parents maintain control:</p>

        <div class="important">
            <p><strong>Parental Control Over AI Tutor:</strong> The AI tutor is OPTIONAL and can be enabled or disabled at any time by parents in the app settings. When disabled, children can still access all educational content, but AI-generated responses and interactive tutoring will not be available.</p>
        </div>

        <p><strong>How the AI Tutor Works:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Processing Method:</strong> When enabled, children's questions and voice input are sent to Google's Gemini AI API for real-time processing</li>
            <li><strong>Content Scope:</strong> Only educational questions about the Quran, Islamic stories, Arabic letters, and prayer concepts are processed</li>
            <li><strong>No Permanent Storage:</strong> Google Gemini processes requests in real-time and does not permanently store children's questions or voice data on Google's servers (per our service agreement)</li>
            <li><strong>Service Provider Role:</strong> Google acts as a service provider on our behalf, not as an independent data controller. They are contractually prohibited from using children's data for their own purposes</li>
            <li><strong>Voice Processing:</strong> When microphone access is granted for recitation practice, audio is processed in real-time for pronunciation feedback and is never stored on our servers or Google's servers</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Google Gemini Privacy:</strong> Google's handling of data processed through the Gemini API is governed by their AI services terms, which prohibit use of customer data for training models or advertising. Full details: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a></p>

        <h3>6.4 Parental Controls and Settings</h3>
        <p>Parents have comprehensive control over their child's experience and data through the PIN-protected settings panel:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>AI Tutor Toggle:</strong> Enable or disable the AI tutor feature at any time via localStorage toggle (takes effect immediately)</li>
            <li><strong>Cloud Sync Control:</strong> Parents must explicitly opt-in to cloud sync in settings. Progress sync to our servers is disabled by default and requires parent activation</li>
            <li><strong>Microphone Permissions:</strong> Parents control whether the app can access the microphone for recitation practice through device settings</li>
            <li><strong>Location Permissions:</strong> Parents control location access (used only for prayer time calculation, not stored) through device settings</li>
            <li><strong>Review Progress:</strong> Parents can review all stars, levels, and achievements earned by their child at any time</li>
            <li><strong>Delete Data:</strong> Parents can request complete deletion of all child data (see Section 6.7)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>6.5 Data Security for Children's Information</h3>
        <p>Children's data receives the same robust security protections as adult data, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Encrypted Transmission:</strong> All data sent to our servers uses HTTPS/TLS encryption</li>
            <li><strong>Secure Database:</strong> PostgreSQL database with SSL connections hosted on Railway's secure infrastructure</li>
            <li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> Only authenticated parent accounts can access associated child progress data</li>
            <li><strong>No Cross-User Sharing:</strong> Children's data is never shared with other users or made public</li>
            <li><strong>Crash Reporting Disabled:</strong> Sentry error tracking is automatically disabled in Kids Mode to prevent any child interaction data from being logged</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>6.6 What We Do NOT Do with Children's Information</h3>
