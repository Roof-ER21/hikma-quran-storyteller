Despite being the wife of a prophet and living in a household of faith, her heart was with the disbelievers. When they fled the city, she looked back in defiance of the command, and was struck by the punishment. This serves as a profound reminder that faith is an individual matter - proximity to righteousness does not guarantee salvation.",

He united the Arabian Peninsula under Islam and laid the foundation for a civilization that would span three continents. His life of 63 years serves as the complete example (Uswah Hasanah) for all Muslims to follow. Sending blessings upon him (Salawat) is commanded in the Quran and is a practice beloved by all Muslims."
